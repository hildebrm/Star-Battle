Namely, I want to look into the star battle puzzle and use python, alongside the solver to create a visual way to represent and solve this puzzle.  The goal of this project is to illustrate my process for solving these puzzles, and then implement it in code, narrating along the way the parts that I had an easy time dealing with, and some of the challenges that came about throughout the project.\n",
